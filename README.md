 # ðŸ“¸ Immich Image Processor

A Python-based image processing system that:
- Extracts metadata from images stored in **Immich**.
- Uses **AI models** (BLIP, ViT, and DETR) for captioning, scene recognition, and object detection.
- Organizes images into **location-based and time-based albums**.
- Stores metadata in a **PostgreSQL database**.
- Uses **reverse geocoding** to generate meaningful album names.
- **Fully logged** with debug mode support.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **AI-Powered Image Analysis**: 
  Extracts captions, classifies scenes, and detects objects using state-of-the-art models.
- **Automatic Album Creation**: 
  Groups images into albums based on location and time.
-% **Reverse Geocoding**: 
  Converts GPS coordinates to city/country names for improved album naming.
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: 
  Stores all processed metadata in a relational database.
-% **Robust Logging**: 
  Logs events to both the console and a file with adjustable debug levels.
-% **Error Handling**: 
  Ensures the process continues gracefully even if errors occur.

## Usage

### Run Image Processing
```sh
python main.py
```
This command will:
- Fetch new images from Immich.
- Process them to extract metadata.
- Organize them into albums based on time and location.

### Reprocess All Images
```sh
python main.py --rerun
```
Forces reprocessing of all images, even if they've been processed before.

### Reprocess a Specific Image
```sh
python main.py --image-id <IMAGE_ID>
```
Processes a single image identified by its Immich ID.

### Enable Debug Mode
```sh
python main.py --debug
```
Activates detailed logging to help with troubleshooting.

### List Existing Albums
```sh
python main.py --list-albums
```
Displays a list of current albums in Immich.
